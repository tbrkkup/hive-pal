# Hive Inspections

Record detailed hive inspections to track colony health, development, and management actions over time.

Inspections are the heart of Hive-Pal. Beyond the standard form described here, you can also record them in several faster ways:

- **[Quick Check](./quick-check)** — a lightweight, tag-based observation when you don't need full ratings.
- **[Batch Inspections](./batch-inspections)** — inspect many hives in one guided run.
- **[Scheduled Inspections](./scheduled-inspections)** — plan inspections ahead using the weather forecast.
- **[Audio & AI Transcription](./audio-ai)** — speak your notes and let AI turn them into structured data.
- **[Bulk Add](./bulk-add)** — apply the same inspection, action, or queen to many hives at once.

## Inspection Modes: Subjective vs Data-Driven

Each apiary chooses how its inspection form works, set in the apiary's settings (`Inspection type`):

- **Subjective** — you rate colony characteristics on a **0–10 scale** based on your own judgement (the default; described under [Observations](#observations) below). Best for quick, consistent trend-tracking.
- **Data-driven** — you record **concrete counts** (such as frames of brood, bees, honey, and pollen) instead of ratings. Best if you prefer objective, repeatable measurements.

The inspection form adapts automatically to the apiary's mode, showing only the relevant fields. Scores and trends are calculated for both modes, so you can compare hives within an apiary regardless of which style you use.

:::tip
Pick one mode per apiary and stick with it — mixing styles within the same apiary makes trends harder to read. You can run different apiaries in different modes.

## Creating an Inspection

### Basic Information

**Hive Selection**
Select the hive you're inspecting from the dropdown menu. The list shows all active hives in your apiaries.

**Inspection Date**
Choose the date of your inspection. You can:
- Record past inspections
- Schedule future inspections (these appear in your calendar)
- Auto-populate weather data for past dates

## Weather Information

The inspection form automatically populates weather data when available for the selected date and apiary.

**Temperature**
- Automatically filled from stored weather data
- Can be manually adjusted if needed
- Displayed in your preferred units (°C or °F)

**Weather Conditions**
Choose from four condition types:
- ☀️ Sunny
- ⛅ Partly Cloudy
- ☁️ Cloudy
- 🌧️ Rainy

*Note: Weather auto-population only works for past dates where weather data has been recorded for the apiary.*

## Observations

Rate colony characteristics on a scale from 0-10, where 0 indicates absence/poor condition and 10 indicates excellent condition.

### Understanding the Rating System

The observation ratings are subjective evaluations based on your assessment of the hive. You can use whatever criteria you see fit for each rating - what constitutes a "10" for colony strength in your apiary may differ from another beekeeper's standards. The key purpose of these ratings is to track progression and changes over time, allowing you to identify trends in colony health and development. For this reason, it's important to maintain consistent rating criteria across all your inspections. Your personal rating scale will become more refined with experience, helping you quickly identify when a colony deviates from its normal patterns.

### Rating Fields

**Colony Strength** (0-10)
Overall vigor and population size of the colony

**Capped Brood** (0-10)
Amount of sealed/pupating brood

**Uncapped Brood** (0-10)
Amount of eggs and larvae

**Honey Stores** (0-10)
Quantity of stored honey

**Pollen Stores** (0-10)
Quantity of stored pollen/bee bread

**Queen Cells** (0-10)
Number of queen cells present

### Additional Observations

**Queen Seen** (checkbox)
Check if you visually confirmed the queen's presence

**Conditional Fields**
When Queen Cells rating > 0, two additional options appear:
- **Swarm Cells**: Indicates preparation for swarming
- **Supersedure Cells**: Indicates queen replacement

## Actions

Document management actions performed during the inspection.

### Feeding
Track supplemental feeding:
- Feed type (sugar syrup, pollen patty, etc.)
- Quantity and unit
- Concentration (for syrups)
- Notes

### Treatment
Record pest/disease treatments:
- Product used
- Amount applied
- Unit of measurement
- Application notes

### Frames
Document frame management:
- Number of frames added/removed
- Frame manipulation details
- Notes

### Note
Add action-specific observations or tasks:
- Custom action descriptions
- Important observations
- Follow-up reminders

## Weight

Record hive weight readings taken during the inspection — for example a full
weighing, or a **Kippprobe** (tilting the hive and lifting one edge with a hook
scale). Add one row per reading with the **Add reading** button.

Each reading captures **where** you measured, so values stay comparable over
time:

- **Position** — the box (Zarge) you lifted at. Choose **Whole hive (base)**
  when you lift the whole stack from the bottom (the reading is not tied to a
  single box), or pick a configured box (e.g. the top honey super).
- **Side** — the edge you lifted at: **Front (entrance)**, **Back**, **Left** or
  **Right**. Choose **Whole (no side)** for a full weighing rather than an
  edge-lift.

Conventions:

- **No side selected** → the value is treated as the **whole/total weight**.
- **Whole hive (base) selected** → the reading was taken at the **base**, lifting
  the whole hive from the bottom.

Weights are stored in kilograms and shown in your preferred unit (kg/lb). The
**Weight** chart in a hive's Analytics tab plots these readings over time,
grouped by position and side, so each measurement spot forms its own trend line.

## Inspection Scoring System

Hive Pal automatically calculates inspection scores to help track colony health trends.

### Score Components

**Population Score**
Weighted average of:
- Colony Strength (weight: 2)
- Capped Brood (weight: 1)
- Uncapped Brood (weight: 1)

**Stores Score**
Weighted average of:
- Honey Stores (weight: 2)
- Pollen Stores (weight: 1)

**Queen Score**
Complex calculation including:
- Queen Cells (inverted: fewer is better, weight: 2)
- Capped Brood (weight: 2)
- Uncapped Brood (weight: 2)
- Swarm Cells (negative indicator, weight: 1)
- Supersedure Cells (negative indicator, weight: 1)
- Queen Seen (positive indicator, weight: 1)

**Overall Score**
Weighted combination:
- Population Score (weight: 2)
- Stores Score (weight: 1)
- Queen Score (weight: 1)

### Automatic Warnings

The system generates warnings for critical conditions:
- **No Brood**: Both capped and uncapped brood are 0
- **Swarm Preparation**: Queen cells present with swarm cells checked
- **Supersedure**: Queen cells present with supersedure cells checked

### Confidence Level

Indicates data completeness (0-100%):
- Based on how many score categories have data
- Higher confidence = more complete inspection data

## Saving Inspections

**Save Options**
- **Save**: Saves inspection as draft (can be edited later)
- **Save and Complete**: Marks inspection as completed
- **Scheduled Inspections**: Automatically marked as completed when saved

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use the same rating criteria across all inspections
2. **Timeliness**: Record inspections immediately while details are fresh
3. **Completeness**: Fill in as many observations as possible for better scoring accuracy
4. **Weather Tracking**: Ensure your apiary has weather integration for automatic data
5. **Action Documentation**: Record all management actions for complete hive history
6. **Regular Schedule**: Maintain consistent inspection intervals for trend analysis
